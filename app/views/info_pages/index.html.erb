              <p>Your new dog was crate trained and socialized at Saving Grace. But that does not guarantee a seamless transition into your life, your house, and your routine. Your dog needs your time and effort to generalize his manners to your life. Set your dog up to succeed by planning ahead of time and sticking to your routine right off the bat.

                <p>***If not properly exercised, confined, supervised and given outlets for normal dog behavior, will chew on your things, counter surf, get into the trash, bark out the window, or be a nuisance in the yard. It is your job to prevent these annoying behaviors so that your dog will rehearse only behaviors that you like.</p>
